## WiiMote-Enabled 3D Boxing Game
A course project that I implemented in MATLAB.

It is a single player 3D boxing game where the user controls his own player (blue) via the Nintendo WiiMote against a computer 
controlled enemy boxer (red). The user can do a straight punch, a jab or an uppercut. With either the left or right hand (one 
hand should be using the WiiMote while other should be using the Nunchuk). Similarly, the computer controlled boxer can 
also do these punches. First boxer to get 10 hits is the winner. 

There is a "Helpers" folder in which I made helper files to help me in figuring out the appropriate settings/values for the 
accelerometer in the controllers (WiiMote and Nunchuk). I used the API provided by WiiLab so as to use the WiiMote in MATLAB.

Usage: run "runme.m" in MATLAB
